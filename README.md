About Me
Hello! I’m a Graphic Artist with a knack for turning imagination into dynamic creations using React technologies, PHP, and JavaScript. My graphic design skills are honed with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Lightroom. I’m proficient in these technologies and always eager to explore and learn more.

Despite graduating with a degree in Secondary Education, majoring in Physical Science, my true passion lies in the arts. This passion has driven me to pursue a career where my expertise in both graphic and web technologies can shine. I am committed to delivering aesthetically pleasing designs to meet your needs.
